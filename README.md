A Flask-based web application which allows the user to save movies into a watchlist with a score of how much they want to watch this in their account.
Movies are added to account via pasting the link of the movie page on IMDB.
You can then view what movies you have in common with another user's watchlist along with an average rating of how much you both want to watch each mutual movie.

Uses SQL to store the users data and IMDB dataset to store movies
